When thinking of Software Engineering I thought of extremely smart people and if it was anything like math maybe I could do it too. I have a cousin that's gone through the program recently and said that although it's challenging to learn it's all rewarding in the end. Being at a job that didn't challenge me for as long as I had, was starting to weigh on me. I was going through the motions each day having felt like I had learned all I could with no change in sight. So when I heard of this program I jumped at the chance at staring my life anew.

Going into the program I began to see the similarities and differences of coding and mathmatics. While I realized that this journey will definitely be more complex than I'm used to I know once I achieve this it will be my hightest accomplishment to date. And even though the thought of change scares me s#!tless I'm ready for this new chapter.
