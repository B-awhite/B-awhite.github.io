As I reflect on the various combinations and different components, this project appeared more complex than anything we have done so far. Due to these complexities I initially felt overwhelmed, so much that I believe it began to hinder me from grasping the concept of Sinatra and what was actually needed in order for everything to flow as it should. Reviewing all the lectures, reading over all the material again, and a few pep talks seemed to be exactly what I needed to chill the hell out and regroup. 

After re-watching the live lectures I began to work through the process or building my application. The different Get requests and routes for CRUD definitely served as another road block to overcome. I however am grateful of the ultimate understanding of what my application required as it boosted my confidence and reminded me of how rewarding coding is and continues to be.
