Honestly the thought of starting my first project initially terrified me, mainly because some of the previous labs challenged me in many areas. The fact though is that in those labs the outcome is already certain. Understanding that this project was to be my of my own creation concerned me some. Specifically because I know how well I wanted to exceed and that I would be fully responible for it's outcome. While I definitely faced various hurdles this week that included finding a good Api that I was able to pull solid data from to having to change my project ideas a few times which ultimately resulted in me having to start over several times. Despite having having countless setbacks I was finally able to develope a functioning project.

Although I was sure not to make it so complex in order to avoid getting in over my head so soon, I'm looking forward to reseaching, learning more, and more trail and errors so that come the next project I'll have the ability to execute the ideas that bubble up in my brain.
